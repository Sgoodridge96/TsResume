TypeScript Resume Write Up

Github Link: https://github.com/Sgoodridge96/TsResume

    This is a Resume website for assignment 5 in COS 320.  This website incorporates all the knowledge
I've gathered throughout the course to build a Resume/Portfolo website with HTML, SCSS, and TypeScript.
I've used TypeScript to make the webpage interactive and give the user feedback when browsing the page.
SCSS was used to shape the structure of the webpage and the HTML was used for the basic format and 
information about me.

    Each page has links to either bring you to my personal GitHub, LinkedIn, and projects, as well as options to also
download my Resume to look at it for themselves.  I went with a simple, yet modern design for my Resume website to put more
emphasis on the projects I've completed and amd currently working on.  I plan to update this as I continue my professional career
and use the current layout as building blocks for future implementations.  

Challenges:
    I based this portfolio website off an old Resume assignment I submitted earlier in the semester, but in TypeScript instead
of JaveScript.  Moving this website from JavaScript to TypeScript was a bit more of a challenge than I initially anticipated, 
but overall, the look and feel of the website was what I was aiming for. 

Bugs:
    I wanted to add the promotional video to the RePoste section in the projects.  Our team for Capstone has not completed
the video as of the date of submission, so this feature was scrapped from the website.

                        <p>
                            I grew up around computers and loved taking hardware components out to figure out how
                            everthing was connected.  After high school, I found a new spark for the software side
                            of computing.  I'm now proficient in Python, C, C#, JavaScript, TypeScript, CSS, SCSS,
                            React, Java, and Linux.  Since my start at the University of Maine, I've recieved an
                            internship oppurtunity from Compotech Inc. with a full time position starting in May 2025.
                            Some further career goals include more AI and machine learning experience.

                    <li class="right-container-item">Education
                        <p>I'm currently studying Computer Science at the University of Maine in Orono and expect
                            to graduate in May of 2025. Before stepping into the field of computer science, I
                            completed my high school diploma at Oceanside High School in Rockland Maine in 2015.

                    <li class="right-container-item">Experience
                        <p>I'm currently working as an intern at Comptech Inc. in Orono with plans to start as
                            a full-time Software Engineer in the summer. Compotech Inc. is a defense technology
                            company that provides defensive services for the military with a focus on AI and machine
                            learning. This experience refined my software development skills and became proficient
                            in Python, PyTorch, Training AI models, annotating data, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

                    <li class="right-container-item">Hobbies
                        <p>Besides programming and development, I enjoy spending time out in the mountains on my
                            bike or skis. If the weather is uncooperative, I can be found playing
                            video games or working on a personal project to pass the time. Check out the link
                            to my GitHub page to see some of the projects I've worked on.
